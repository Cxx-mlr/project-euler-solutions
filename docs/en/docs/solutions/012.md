# Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

## Problem Statement

The sequence of triangular numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7^{\text{th}}$ triangular number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be.

$$
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\mathbf{1}  & :\ 1 \\
\mathbf{3}  & :\ 1, 3 \\
\mathbf{6}  & :\ 1, 2, 3, 6 \\
\mathbf{10} & :\ 1, 2, 5, 10 \\
\mathbf{15} & :\ 1, 3, 5, 15 \\
\mathbf{21} & :\ 1, 3, 7, 21 \\
\mathbf{28} & :\ 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 \\
\end{array}
$$

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
