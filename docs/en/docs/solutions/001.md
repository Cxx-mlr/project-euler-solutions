# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

## Problem Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Approach and Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all natural numbers below 1000 and check if each number is a multiple of either 3 or 5. If it is, we will add it to a cumulative sum.

1. **Initialization**: Start with a sum of 0.
2. **Loop through numbers**: Check each number from 1 to 999.
3. **Check divisibility**: If the number is divisible by 3 or 5, add it to the sum.
4. **Output the result**: Print the total sum.
