# About This Site

This site, **Project Euler Solutions**, serves as a personal repository of my solutions to Project Euler problems. My goal is to provide clear, documented solutions that emphasize both the mathematical and computational aspects of each problem. 

Each solution includes:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem to provide context.
- **Approach and Strategy**: Explanation of the techniques, algorithms, or formulas used to solve the problem.
- **Code Implementation**: Annotated Python code with comments for clarity.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Insights into the efficiency of the solution and possible improvements.

The site is built using MkDocs with the Material theme, making it easy to navigate and well-suited for reading code. Feel free to explore the solutions, and connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn if you'd like to discuss a problem or approach.

Happy problem-solving!
