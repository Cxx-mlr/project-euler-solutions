# Welcome to Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to **Project Euler Solutions**! This site is a personal project where I share my solutions to various Project Euler challenges. Each solution is written in Python, with detailed explanations of the problem-solving approach, code, and complexity analysis.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a well-known collection of challenging mathematical problems that require programming skills to solve. It is a great platform for developing and testing algorithmic thinking, as each problem pushes for creative and optimized solutions. If you’re new to Project Euler, consider reading more about it on our [About Project Euler](about_project_euler.md) page.

## What You’ll Find Here

This site is organized into several main sections to help you navigate:

- **Introduction**:
  - **[About Project Euler](about_project_euler.md)**: Learn more about Project Euler and its mission to foster analytical and problem-solving skills.
  - **[About This Site](about_this_site.md)**: Understand the purpose and structure of this site and what to expect from each solution.

- **Solutions**:
  - Solutions are grouped into ranges (e.g., Problems 1-10) for easier navigation. Each solution page includes:
    - A **problem statement** summarizing the challenge.
    - An **approach and strategy** section to explain the solution method.
    - The **code implementation**, written in Python and annotated for clarity.
    - **Complexity analysis** to discuss the efficiency of the solution.

Feel free to explore the solutions and see how each problem is approached, solved, and optimized. This site is a work in progress, and I will be adding new solutions over time. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cxx-mlr) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-papiernik-7502342b2/) if you’d like to connect or discuss Project Euler.
