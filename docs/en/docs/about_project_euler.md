# About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require creative problem-solving, analytical skills, and a good understanding of programming. It began in 2001, initiated by Colin Hughes, and has grown into an international community where math and programming enthusiasts collaborate and share insights.

The goal of Project Euler is not only to find the correct answer but to derive efficient and optimized solutions that can handle large data inputs. This site shares solutions to select Project Euler problems, highlighting techniques and approaches that are useful for both beginners and advanced problem-solvers.
